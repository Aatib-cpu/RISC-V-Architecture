# RISC V
RISC-V is an open-source processor architecture designed to be simple, flexible, and free to use. It follows the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) model, using a small set of instructions for efficient performance. Created at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V can be used in everything from small devices like sensors to large systems like servers. Its open nature means anyone can study, modify, or build with it without licensing fees. This makes RISC-V popular for education, research, and product development, encouraging innovation in hardware and software design.

RISC-V has four core instruction formats: R, I, S, and U. Additionally, there are two sub-formats: SB and UJ, commonly referred to as B-type and J-type, respectively. They are named this way because the B-type shares the same instruction format as the S-type, and the J-type shares the same format as the U-type. This image shows the instuction encoding of RV32I:

In each instruction format, the 32-bit instruction is divided into fields that define the operation and the operands. The opcode, funct3, and funct7 fields determine the operation to be executed, while the remaining bits specify the operands involved. In RV32I, there are 32 general-purpose registers, each 32 bits wide, named x0 to x31. Among these, special-purpose registers exist—x0 is hardwired to zero and cannot be modified, while the program counter (PC) holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. Following tabels describe all registers with their aliases based on their conventional uses.

RV32I includes a total of 47 instructions, but a core set of 37 instructions (excluding NOP, ECALL, EBREAK, and other synchronization or pseudo-instructions) is sufficient to perform all fundamental integer operations. Here are the 37 instruction encoding with assembly level instruction.

Except for R-type instructions, all other instruction formats include one operand embedded within the instruction itself, which is used to obtain an immediate value. To form a 32-bit immediate, different alignment and extension techniques are applied depending on the instruction type. For signed operations, the immediate is sign-extended using the most significant bit (MSB), while for unsigned operations, it is zero-extended.
